Ancient greek shortsword, originally made for playing on the Sktp_plagueisle map (which I recommend btw.) It comes in 3 variants using the same model: seis_Xiphos_bare is a machete, same reach, same damage. seis_Xiphos_bestblade is the variant I´d recommend, the reach of a machete and the damage of a fireaxe so probably the best melee weapon in the game. There´s also seis_Xiphos_vorpal which as the name implies goes snicker-snack, does 1000 dmg and allows you to take on bears in melee. Maybe useful for those looking to unleash their inner god of war. The variants have different descriptions but look the same, so one would only want to have one variant on a server.

The original 3d model is by ZachWilkins1997, released under CC-Attribution meaning as long as you credit him, you can do whatever you want.
